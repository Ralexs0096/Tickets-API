# About this project

This project was granted the idea to help the operators of a production system to handle the excessive quantity of "labels" printed for production control.

### Terms used within the company's processes

- **Cut**: is the way to refer to a style of shirt with all its specifications, sizes, and type of fabric used to make the garment.
- **Area**: Like many companies, the production of a product is distributed through different areas, and this is the term used to indicate it without further ado.
- **Label**: This element contains the cost of a garment manufacturing process and the quantity of manufactured pieces.
- **Production floor**: is the name given to the set of sections in which the garment is prepared and assembled, from refining a piece to packaging.

### History and issue

The operator of a production system is in chaos because he needs an optimal way to manage the delivery and tracking of the system's labels.

He needs to know the area to which the labels were delivered, who the receptor was, and the delivery date, but this is difficult because the operator needs to print between 10 and 20 "cuts" by day, and each "cut" has between 4 and 6 areas.

Once the labels are printed, they are separated into 4 or 6 sections. Each section must be delivered to a specific area; the label contains the area's name and sub-areas, complicating the label management.

### Main areas

Below, we will mention the main areas to which the labels must be delivered and their function within the process to have more context.

- **Cutting area**: In this area, the fabric that will be used for the elaboration of the garments in their different sizes is cut (this fabric can be stored for future fabrications or delivered directly to the production floor).

- **Parts area**: In this area all the pieces that were cut in the cutting area are refined and ready to be assembled. Some of the sub-areas are: Sleeve, Collar, Breastplate, Back, Cuff.
- **Assembly area**: All the pieces tuned in the parts area are joined together, and the garment is ready to be packaged.
- **Packing area**: Finally, in this area, the whole process of packing the pieces and labeling the boxes to be exported and added to a tracking system is carried
