# About this project

This project was granted the idea to help the operators of a production system to handle the excessive quantity of "labels" printed for production control.

### Terms used within the company's processes

- Cut: is the way to refer to a style of shirt with all its specifications, sizes, and type of fabric used to make the garment.
- Area: Like many companies, the production of a product is distributed through different areas, and this is the term used to indicate it without further ado.
- Label: This element contains the cost of a garment manufacturing process and the quantity of manufactured pieces.

### History and issue

The operator of a production system is in chaos because he needs an optimal way to manage the delivery and tracking of the system's labels.

He needs to know the area to which the labels were delivered, who the receptor was, and the delivery date, but this is difficult because the operator needs to print between 10 and 20 "cuts" by day, and each "cut" has between 4 and 6 areas.

Once the labels are printed, they are separated into 4 or 6 sections. Each section must be delivered to a specific area; the label contains the area's name and sub-areas, complicating the label management.
